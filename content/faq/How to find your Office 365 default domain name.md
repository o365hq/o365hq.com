1.  Please log in to your [Office 365 Admin
    Center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/homepage) using
    your Global Administrator credentials.
2.  Under **Settings** click on **Domains** (or just [click
    here](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/Domains)).
3.  Look for the domain name marked **(Default)** in the **Domain
    name** column. This is your *default domain name for your Office 365
    tenant*. It may or may not be the same as your [Office 365 tenant
    name](o365hq.com/faq/how-to-find-your-office-365-tenant-name).
